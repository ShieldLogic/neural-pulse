It can accept <strong>compositional function and organism prompts</strong>, and can be <strong>trained on sequence databases</strong>, which are 2-4 orders of magnitude larger than structure databases. Unlike many previous protein structure generative models, PLAID addresses the multimodal co-generation problem setting: simultaneously generating both discrete sequence and continuous all-atom structural coordinates.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"from-structure-prediction-to-real-world-drug-design\">From structure prediction to real-world drug design</h2>\n\n<p>Though recent works demonstrate promise for the ability of diffusion models to generate proteins, there still exist limitations of previous models that make them impractical for real-world applications, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><span style=\"color: #17a589;\"><strong>All-atom generation</strong></span>: Many existing generative models only produce the backbone atoms. To produce the all-atom structure and place the sidechain atoms, we need to know the sequence. This creates a multimodal generation problem that requires simultaneous generation of discrete and continuous modalities.</li>\n  <li><span style=\"color: #dc7633;\"><strong>Organism specificity</strong></span>: Proteins biologics intended for human use need to be <em>humanized</em>, to avoid being destroyed by the human immune system.</li>\n  <li><span style=\"color: #9F2B68;\"><strong>Control specification</strong></span>: Drug discovery and putting it into the hands of patients is a complex process. How can we specify these complex constraints? For example, even after the biology is tackled, you might decide that tablets are easier to transport than vials, adding a new constraint on soluability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"generating-useful-proteins\">Generating \u201cuseful\u201d proteins</h2>\n\n<p>Simply generating proteins is not as useful as  <span style=\"color: #9F2B68;\"><em>controlling</em></span> the generation to get <em>useful</em> proteins. What might an interface for this look like?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/plaid/image2.jpg\" width=\"70%\" />\n<br />\n<i>For inspiration, let's consider how we'd control image generation via compositional textual prompts (example from <a href=\"https://energy-based-model.github.io/Compositional-Visual-Generation-with-Composable-Diffusion-Models/\">Liu et al., 2022</a>).</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>In PLAID, we mirror this interface for <span style=\"color: #9F2B68;\">control specification</span>. The ultimate goal is to control generation entirely via a textual interface, but here we consider compositional constraints for two axes as a proof-of-concept: <span style=\"color: #9F2B68;\">function</span> and <span style=\"color: #dc7633;\">organism</span>:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/plaid/image3.jpg\" width=\"70%\" />\n<br />\n<i><b>Learning the function-structure-sequence connection.</b> PLAID learns the tetrahedral cysteine-Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> coordination pattern often found in metalloproteins, while maintaining high sequence-level diversity.</i>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"training-using-sequence-only-training-data\">Training using sequence-only training data</h2>\n<p><strong>Another important aspect of the PLAID model is that we only require sequences to train the generative model!</strong> Generative models learn the data distribution defined by its training data, and sequence databases are considerably larger than structural ones, since sequences are much cheaper to obtain than experimental structure.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/plaid/image4.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br />\n<i><b>Learning from a larger and broader database.</b> The cost of obtaining protein sequences is much lower than experimentally characterizing structure, and sequence databases are 2-4 orders of magnitude larger than structural ones.</i>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>The reason that we\u2019re able to train the generative model to generate structure by only using sequence data is by learning a diffusion model over the <em>latent space of a protein folding model</em>. Then, during inference, after sampling from this latent space of valid proteins, we can take <em>frozen weights</em> from the protein folding model to decode structure. Here, we use <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574\">ESMFold</a>, a successor to the AlphaFold2 model which replaces a retrieval step with a protein language model.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/plaid/image5.jpg\" width=\"80%\" />\n<br />\n<i><b>Our method.</b> During training, only sequences are needed to obtain the embedding; during inference, we can decode sequence and structure from the sampled embedding. \u2744\ufe0f denotes frozen weights.\n</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>In this way, we can use structural understanding information in the weights of pretrained protein folding models for the protein design task. This is analogous to how vision-language-action (VLA) models in robotics make use of priors contained in vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data to supply perception and reasoning and understanding information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"compressing-the-latent-space-of-protein-folding-models\">Compressing the latent space of protein folding models</h2>\n\n<p>A small wrinkle with directly applying this method is that the latent space of ESMFold \u2013 indeed, the latent space of many transformer-based models \u2013 requires a lot of regularization. This space is also very large, so learning this embedding ends up mapping to high-resolution image synthesis.</p>\n\n<p>To address this, we also propose <strong><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.06.606920v2\">CHEAP</a> (Compressed Hourglass Embedding Adaptations of Proteins)</strong>, where we learn a compression model for the joint embedding of protein sequence and structure.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/plaid/image6.jpg\" width=\"80%\" />\n<br />\n<i><b>Investigating the latent space.</b> (A) When we visualize the mean value for each channel, some channels exhibit \u201cmassive activations\u201d. (B) If we start examining the top-3 activations compared to the median value (gray), we find that this happens over many layers. (C) Massive activations have also been observed for other transformer-based models.</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>We find that this latent space is actually highly compressible. By doing a bit of mechanistic interpretability to better understand the base model that we are working with, we were able to create an all-atom protein generative model.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What\u2019s next?</h2>\n\n<p>Though we examine the case of protein sequence and structure generation in this work, we can adapt this method to perform multi-modal generation for any modalities where there is a predictor from a more abundant modality to a less abundant one. As sequence-to-structure predictors for proteins are beginning to tackle increasingly complex systems (e.g. AlphaFold3 is also able to predict proteins in complex with nucleic acids and molecular ligands), it\u2019s easy to imagine performing multimodal generation over more complex systems using the same method. \nIf you are interested in collaborating to extend our method, or to test our method in the wet-lab, please reach out!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-links\">Further links</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve found our papers useful in your research, please consider using the following BibTeX for PLAID and CHEAP:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>@article{lu2024generating,\n  title={Generating All-Atom Protein Structure from Sequence-Only Training Data},\n  author={Lu, Amy X and Yan, Wilson and Robinson, Sarah A and Yang, Kevin K and Gligorijevic, Vladimir and Cho, Kyunghyun and Bonneau, Richard and Abbeel, Pieter and Frey, Nathan},\n  journal={bioRxiv},\n  pages={2024--12},\n  year={2024},\n  publisher={Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory}\n}\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>@article{lu2024tokenized,\n  title={Tokenized and Continuous Embedding Compressions of Protein Sequence and Structure},\n  author={Lu, Amy X and Yan, Wilson and Yang, Kevin K and Gligorijevic, Vladimir and Cho, Kyunghyun and Abbeel, Pieter and Bonneau, Richard and Frey, Nathan},\n  journal={bioRxiv},\n  pages={2024--08},\n  year={2024},\n  publisher={Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory}\n}\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>You can also checkout our preprints (<a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.02.626353v2\">PLAID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.06.606920v2\">CHEAP</a>) and codebases (<a href=\"https://github.com/amyxlu/plaid\">PLAID</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/amyxlu/cheap-proteins\">CHEAP</a>).</p>\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"some-bonus-protein-generation-fun\">Some bonus protein generation fun!</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/plaid/image7.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br />\n<i>Additional function-prompted generations with PLAID.\n</i>\n</p>\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/plaid/image9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br />\n<i>\nUnconditional generation with PLAID.\n</i>\n</p>\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/plaid/image10.jpg\" width=\"90%\" />\n<br />\n<i>Transmembrane proteins have hydrophobic residues at the core, where it is embedded within the fatty acid layer.

Humans routinely look first and act second\u2014our eyes lock onto a goal, the brain runs a brief visual \u201csimulation\u201d of the outcome, and only then does the body move. At every moment, our egocentric view both serves as input from the environment and reflects the intention/goal behind the next movement. When we consider our body movements, we should consider both actions of the feet (locomotion and navigation) and the actions of the hand (manipulation), or more generally, whole-body control.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-did-we-do\">What Did We Do?</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/peva/what_did_we_do_web.png\" width=\"80%\" />\n</p>\n<p>We trained a model to <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">P</span>redict <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">E</span>go-centric <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">V</span>ideo from human <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">A</span>ctions (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21552\" target=\"_blank\">PEVA</a>) for Whole-Body-Conditioned Egocentric Video Prediction. PEVA conditions on kinematic pose trajectories structured by the body\u2019s joint hierarchy, learning to simulate how physical human actions shape the environment from a first-person view. We train an autoregressive conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset pairing real-world egocentric video with body pose capture. Our hierarchical evaluation protocol tests increasingly challenging tasks, providing comprehensive analysis of the model\u2019s embodied prediction and control abilities. This work represents an initial attempt to model complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors through human-perspective video prediction.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"method\">Method</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"structured-action-representation-from-motion\">Structured Action Representation from Motion</h3>\n<p>To bridge human motion and egocentric vision, we represent each action as a rich, high-dimensional vector capturing both full-body dynamics and detailed joint movements. Instead of using simplified controls, we encode global translation and relative joint rotations based on the body\u2019s kinematic tree. Motion is represented in 3D space with 3 degrees of freedom for root translation and 15 upper-body joints. Using Euler angles for relative joint rotations yields a 48-dimensional action space (3 + 15 \u00d7 3 = 48). Motion capture data is aligned with video using timestamps, then converted from global coordinates to a pelvis-centered local frame for position and orientation invariance. All positions and rotations are normalized to ensure stable learning. Each action captures inter-frame motion changes, enabling the model to connect physical movement with visual consequences over time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"design-of-peva-autoregressive-conditional-diffusion-transformer\">Design of PEVA: Autoregressive Conditional Diffusion Transformer</h3>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/peva/method_web.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br />\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>While the Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT) from Navigation World Models uses simple control signals like velocity and rotation, modeling whole-body human motion presents greater challenges. Human actions are high-dimensional, temporally extended, and physically constrained. To address these challenges, we extend the CDiT method in three ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Random Timeskips</strong>: Allows the model to learn both short-term motion dynamics and longer-term activity patterns.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sequence-Level Training</strong>: Models entire motion sequences by applying loss over each frame prefix.</li>\n  <li><strong>Action Embeddings</strong>: Concatenates all actions at time t into a 1D tensor to condition each AdaLN layer for high-dimensional whole-body motion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"sampling-and-rollout-strategy\">Sampling and Rollout Strategy</h3>\n<p>At test time, we generate future frames by conditioning on a set of past context frames. We encode these frames into latent states and add noise to the target frame, which is then progressively denoised using our diffusion model. To speed up inference, we restrict attention, where within image attention is applied only to the target frame and context cross attention is only applied for the last frame. For action-conditioned prediction, we use an autoregressive rollout strategy. Starting with context frames, we encode them using a VAE encoder and append the current action. The model then predicts the next frame, which is added to the context while dropping the oldest frame, and the process repeats for each action in the sequence. Finally, we decode the predicted latents into pixel-space using a VAE decoder.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"atomic-actions\">Atomic Actions</h3>\n<p>We decompose complex human movements into atomic actions\u2014such as hand movements (up, down, left, right) and whole-body movements (forward, rotation)\u2014to test the model\u2019s understanding of how specific joint-level movements affect the egocentric view.

Unlike traditional methods, this algorithm is <em>not</em> based on temporal difference (TD) learning (which has <a href=\"https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/\">scalability challenges</a>), and scales well to long-horizon tasks.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/teaser_short.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br />\n<i style=\"font-size: 0.9em;\">We can do Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on divide and conquer, instead of temporal difference (TD) learning.</i>\n</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"problem-setting-off-policy-rl\">Problem setting: off-policy RL</h2>\n\n<p>Our problem setting is <strong>off-policy RL</strong>. Let\u2019s briefly review what this means.</p>\n\n<p>There are two classes of algorithms in RL: on-policy RL and off-policy RL. On-policy RL means we can <em>only</em> use fresh data collected by the current policy. In other words, we have to throw away old data each time we update the policy. Algorithms like PPO and GRPO (and policy gradient methods in general) belong to this category.</p>\n\n<p>Off-policy RL means we don\u2019t have this restriction: we can use <em>any</em> kind of data, including old experience, human demonstrations, Internet data, and so on. So off-policy RL is more general and flexible than on-policy RL (and of course harder!). Q-learning is the most well-known off-policy RL algorithm. In domains where data collection is expensive (<em>e.g.</em>, <strong>robotics</strong>, dialogue systems, healthcare, etc.), we often have no choice but to use off-policy RL. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such an important problem.</p>\n\n<p>As of 2025, I think we have reasonably good recipes for scaling up on-policy RL (<em>e.g.</em>, PPO, GRPO, and their variants). However, we still haven\u2019t found a \u201cscalable\u201d <em>off-policy RL</em> algorithm that scales well to complex, long-horizon tasks. Let me briefly explain why.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"two-paradigms-in-value-learning-temporal-difference-td-and-monte-carlo-mc\">Two paradigms in value learning: Temporal Difference (TD) and Monte Carlo (MC)</h2>\n\n<p>In off-policy RL, we typically train a value function using temporal difference (TD) learning (<em>i.e.</em>, Q-learning), with the following Bellman update rule:</p>\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} Q(s, a) \\gets r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a'), \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n<p>The problem is this: the error in the next value $Q(s\u2019, a\u2019)$ propagates to the current value $Q(s, a)$ through bootstrapping, and these errors <em>accumulate</em> over the entire horizon. This is basically what makes TD learning struggle to scale to long-horizon tasks (see <a href=\"https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/\">this post</a> if you\u2019re interested in more details).</p>\n\n<p>To mitigate this problem, people have mixed TD learning with Monte Carlo (MC) returns. For example, we can do $n$-step TD learning (TD-$n$):</p>\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} Q(s_t, a_t) \\gets \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\gamma^i r_{t+i} + \\gamma^n \\max_{a'} Q(s_{t+n}, a'). \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n<p>Here, we use the actual Monte Carlo return (from the dataset) for the first $n$ steps, and then use the bootstrapped value for the rest of the horizon. This way, we can reduce the number of Bellman recursions by $n$ times, so errors accumulate less. In the extreme case of $n = \\infty$, we recover pure Monte Carlo value learning.</p>\n\n<p>While this is a reasonable solution (and often <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04168\">works well</a>), it is highly unsatisfactory. First, it doesn\u2019t <em>fundamentally</em> solve the error accumulation problem; it only reduces the number of Bellman recursions by a constant factor ($n$). Second, as $n$ grows, we suffer from high variance and suboptimality. So we can\u2019t just set $n$ to a large value, and need to carefully tune it for each task.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a fundamentally different way to solve this problem?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-third-paradigm-divide-and-conquer\">The \u201cThird\u201d Paradigm: Divide and Conquer</h2>\n\n<p>My claim is that a <em>third</em> paradigm in value learning, <strong>divide and conquer</strong>, may provide an ideal solution to off-policy RL that scales to arbitrarily long-horizon tasks.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl-without-td-learning/teaser.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br />\n<i style=\"font-size: 0.9em;\">Divide and conquer reduces the number of Bellman recursions logarithmically.</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>The key idea of divide and conquer is to divide a trajectory into two equal-length segments, and combine their values to update the value of the full trajectory. This way, we can (in theory) reduce the number of Bellman recursions <em>logarithmically</em> (not linearly!). Moreover, it doesn\u2019t require choosing a hyperparameter like $n$, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily suffer from high variance or suboptimality, unlike $n$-step TD learning.</p>\n\n<p>Conceptually, divide and conquer really has all the nice properties we want in value learning. So I\u2019ve long been excited about this high-level idea. The problem was that it wasn\u2019t clear how to actually do this in practice\u2026 until recently.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-practical-algorithm\">A practical algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512\">recent work</a> co-led with <a href=\"https://aober.ai/\">Aditya</a>, we made meaningful progress toward realizing and scaling up this idea. Specifically, we were able to scale up divide-and-conquer value learning to highly complex tasks (as far as I know, this is the first such work!) at least in one important class of RL problems, <em>goal-conditioned RL</em>. Goal-conditioned RL aims to learn a policy that can reach any state from any other state. This provides a natural divide-and-conquer structure. Let me explain this.</p>\n\n<p>The structure is as follows. Let\u2019s first assume that the dynamics is deterministic, and denote the shortest path distance (\u201ctemporal distance\u201d) between two states $s$ and $g$ as $d^*(s, g)$. Then, it satisfies the triangle inequality:</p>\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} d^*(s, g) \\leq d^*(s, w) + d^*(w, g) \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n<p>for all $s, g, w \\in \\mathcal{S}$.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of values, we can equivalently translate this triangle inequality to the following <em>\u201ctransitive\u201d</em> Bellman update rule:</p>\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \nV(s, g) \\gets \\begin{cases}\n\\gamma^0 &amp; \\text{if } s = g, \\\\\\\\ \n\\gamma^1 &amp; \\text{if } (s, g) \\in \\mathcal{E}, \\\\\\\\ \n\\max_{w \\in \\mathcal{S}} V(s, w)V(w, g) &amp; \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases} \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n<p>where $\\mathcal{E}$ is the set of edges in the environment\u2019s transition graph, and $V$ is the value function associated with the sparse reward $r(s, g) = 1(s = g)$. <strong>Intuitively</strong>, this means that we can update the value of $V(s, g)$ using two \u201csmaller\u201d values: $V(s, w)$ and $V(w, g)$, provided that $w$ is the optimal \u201cmidpoint\u201d (subgoal) on the shortest path. This is exactly the divide-and-conquer value update rule that we were looking for!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h3>\n\n<p>However, there\u2019s one problem here. The issue is that it\u2019s unclear how to choose the optimal subgoal $w$ in practice. In tabular settings, we can simply enumerate all states to find the optimal $w$ (this is essentially the Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm). But in continuous environments with large state spaces, we can\u2019t do this. Basically, this is why previous works have struggled to scale up divide-and-conquer value learning, even though this idea has been around for decades (in fact, it dates back to the very first work in goal-conditioned RL by <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;citation_for_view=IcasIiwAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC\">Kaelbling (1993)</a> \u2013 see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22512\">our paper</a> for a further discussion of related works). The main contribution of our work is a practical solution to this issue.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h3>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s our key idea: we <em>restrict</em> the search space of $w$ to the states that appear in the dataset, specifically, those that lie between $s$ and $g$ in the dataset trajectory. Also, instead of searching for the optimal $\\text{argmax}_w$, we compute a \u201csoft\u201d $\\text{argmax}$ using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06169\">expectile regression</a>. Namely, we minimize the following loss:</p>\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\ell^2_\\kappa (V(s_i, s_j) - \\bar{V}(s_i, s_k) \\bar{V}(s_k, s_j))\\right], \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n<p>where $\\bar{V}$ is the target value network, $\\ell^2_\\kappa$ is the expectile loss with an expectile $\\kappa$, and the expectation is taken over all $(s_i, s_k, s_j)$ tuples with $i \\leq k \\leq j$ in a randomly sampled dataset trajectory.</p>\n\n<p>This has two benefits. First, we don\u2019t need to search over the entire state space. Second, we prevent value overestimation from the $\\max$ operator by instead using the \u201csofter\u201d expectile regression. We call this algorithm <strong>Transitive RL (TRL)</strong>.

This is just the beginning of the journey. There are many open questions and exciting directions to explore:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Perhaps the most important question is how to extend TRL to regular, reward-based RL tasks beyond goal-conditioned RL. Would regular RL have a similar divide-and-conquer structure that we can exploit? I\u2019m quite optimistic about this, given that it is possible to convert any reward-based RL task to a goal-conditioned one at least in theory (see page 40 of <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/goalconditioned-rl/\">this book</a>).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Another important challenge is to deal with stochastic environments. The current version of TRL assumes deterministic dynamics, but many real-world environments are stochastic, mainly due to partial observability. For this, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098\">\u201cstochastic\u201d triangle inequalities</a> might provide some hints.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Practically, I think there is still a lot of room to further improve TRL. For example, we can find better ways to choose subgoal candidates (beyond the ones from the same trajectory), further reduce hyperparameters, further stabilize training, and simplify the algorithm even more.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In general, I\u2019m really excited about the potential of the divide-and-conquer paradigm. I <a href=\"https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/\">still</a> think one of the most important problems in RL (and even in machine learning) is to find a <em>scalable</em> off-policy RL algorithm. I don\u2019t know what the final solution will look like, but I do think divide and conquer, or <strong>recursive</strong> decision-making in general, is one of the strongest candidates toward this holy grail (by the way, I think the other strong contenders are (1) model-based RL and (2) TD learning with some \u201cmagic\u201d tricks). Indeed, several recent works in other fields have shown the promise of recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies, such as <a href=\"https://kvfrans.com/shortcut-models/\">shortcut models</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04761\">log-linear attention</a>, and <a href=\"https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/\">recursive language models</a> (and of course, classic algorithms like quicksort, segment trees, FFT, and so on). I hope to see more exciting progress in scalable off-policy RL in the near future!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h3>\n\n<p>I\u2019d like to thank <a href=\"https://kvfrans.com/\">Kevin</a> and <a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/\">Sergey</a> for their helpful feedback on this post.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"https://seohong.me/blog/rl-without-td-learning/\">Seohong Park\u2019s blog</a>.</em></p>",

Answering this question amounts to understanding representation learning in a minimal yet interesting language modeling task. Despite the fact that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> is a well-known precursor to modern language models, for many years, researchers lacked a quantitative and predictive theory describing its learning process. In our new <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09863\">paper</a>, we finally provide such a theory. We prove that there are realistic, practical regimes in which the learning problem reduces to <em>unweighted least-squares matrix factorization</em>. We solve the gradient flow dynamics in closed form; the final learned representations are simply given by PCA.</p>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/qwem-word2vec-theory/fig1.c8u1a3E7_Z23iPso.webp\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br />\n<i style=\"font-size: 0.9em;\"><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09863\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Learning dynamics of word2vec</strong></a>.

Right: three time slices of the latent embedding space showing how embedding vectors expand into subspaces of increasing dimension at each learning step, continuing until model capacity is saturated.</i>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Before elaborating on this result, let\u2019s motivate the problem. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> is a well-known algorithm for learning dense vector representations of words. These embedding vectors are trained using a contrastive algorithm; at the end of training, the semantic relation between any two words is captured by the angle between the corresponding embeddings. In fact, the learned embeddings empirically exhibit striking linear structure in their geometry: linear subspaces in the latent space often encode interpretable concepts such as gender, verb tense, or dialect. This so-called <em>linear representation hypothesis</em> has recently garnered a lot of attention since <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03658\">LLMs exhibit this behavior as well</a>, enabling <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00941\">semantic inspection of internal representations</a> and providing for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405\">novel model steering techniques</a>. In <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code>, it is precisely these linear directions that enable the learned embeddings to complete analogies (e.g., \u201cman : woman :: king : queen\u201d) via embedding vector addition.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this shouldn\u2019t be too surprising: after all, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> algorithm simply iterates through a text corpus and trains a two-layer linear network to model statistical regularities in natural language using self-supervised gradient descent. In this framing, it\u2019s clear that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> is a minimal neural language model. Understanding <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> is thus a prerequisite to understanding feature learning in more sophisticated language modeling tasks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-result\">The Result</h2>\n\n<p>With this motivation in mind, let\u2019s describe the main result. Concretely, suppose we initialize all the embedding vectors randomly and very close to the origin, so that they\u2019re effectively zero-dimensional. Then (under some mild approximations) the embeddings collectively learn one \u201cconcept\u201d (i.e., orthogonal linear subspace) at a time in a sequence of discrete learning steps.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s like when diving head-first into learning a new branch of math. At first, all the jargon is muddled \u2014 what\u2019s the difference between a function and a functional? What about a linear operator vs. a matrix? Slowly, through exposure to new settings of interest, the words separate from each other in the mind and their true meanings become clearer.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, each new realized linear concept effectively increments the rank of the embedding matrix, giving each word embedding more space to better express itself and its meaning. Since these linear subspaces do not rotate once they\u2019re learned, these are effectively the model\u2019s learned features. Our theory allows us to compute each of these features a priori in <em>closed form</em> \u2013 they are simply the eigenvectors of a particular target matrix which is defined solely in terms of measurable corpus statistics and algorithmic hyperparameters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-features\">What are the features?</h3>\n\n<p>The answer is remarkably straightforward: the latent features are simply the top eigenvectors of the following matrix:</p>\n\n\\[M^{\\star}_{ij} = \\frac{P(i,j) - P(i)P(j)}{\\frac{1}{2}(P(i,j) + P(i)P(j))}\\]\n\n<p>where $i$ and $j$ index the words in the vocabulary, $P(i,j)$ is the co-occurrence probability for words $i$ and $j$, and $P(i)$ is the unigram probability for word $i$ (i.e., the marginal of $P(i,j)$).</p>\n\n<p>Constructing and diagonalizing this matrix from the Wikipedia statistics, one finds that the top eigenvector selects words associated with celebrity biographies, the second eigenvector selects words associated with government and municipal administration, the third is associated with geographical and cartographical descriptors, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The takeaway is this: during training, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> finds a sequence of optimal low-rank approximations of $M^{\\star}$. It\u2019s effectively equivalent to running PCA on $M^{\\star}$.</p>\n\n<p>The following plots illustrate this behavior.</p>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/qwem-word2vec-theory/fig2.C4kWlUSu_ZJTCeE.webp\" width=\"100%\" />\n<br />\n<i style=\"font-size: 0.9em;\">Learning dynamics comparison showing discrete, sequential learning steps.</i>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>On the left, the key empirical observation is that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> (plus our mild approximations) learns in a sequence of essentially discrete steps. Each step increments the effective rank of the embeddings, resulting in a stepwise decrease in the loss. On the right, we show three time slices of the latent embedding space, demonstrating how the embeddings expand along a new orthogonal direction at each learning step. Furthermore, by inspecting the words that most strongly align with these singular directions, we observe that each discrete \u201cpiece of knowledge\u201d corresponds to an interpretable topic-level concept. These learning dynamics are solvable in closed form, and we see an excellent match between the theory and numerical experiment.</p>\n\n<p>What are the mild approximations? They are: 1) quartic approximation of the objective function around the origin; 2) a particular constraint on the algorithmic hyperparameters; 3) sufficiently small initial embedding weights; and 4) vanishingly small gradient descent steps. Thankfully, these conditions are not too strong, and in fact they\u2019re quite similar to the setting described in the original <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> paper.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, none of the approximations involve the data distribution! Indeed, a huge strength of the theory is that it makes no distributional assumptions. As a result, the theory predicts exactly what features are learned in terms of the corpus statistics and the algorithmic hyperparameters. This is particularly useful, since fine-grained descriptions of learning dynamics in the distribution-agnostic setting are rare and hard to obtain; to our knowledge, this is the first one for a practical natural language task.</p>\n\n<p>As for the approximations we do make, we empirically show that our theoretical result still provides a faithful description of the original <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code>. As a coarse indicator of the agreement between our approximate setting and true <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code>, we can compare the empirical scores on the standard analogy completion benchmark: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> achieves 68% accuracy, the approximate model we study achieves 66%, and the standard classical alternative (known as PPMI) only gets 51%. Check out our paper to see plots with detailed comparisons.</p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate the usefulness of the result, we apply our theory to study the emergence of abstract linear representations (corresponding to binary concepts such as masculine/feminine or past/future). We find that over the course of learning, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">word2vec</code> builds these linear representations in a sequence of noisy learning steps, and their geometry is well-described by a spiked random matrix model. Early in training, semantic signal dominates; however, later in training, noise may begin to dominate, causing a degradation of the model\u2019s ability to resolve the linear representation. See our paper for more details.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, this result gives one of the first complete closed-form theories of feature learning in a minimal yet relevant natural language task. In this sense, we believe our work is an important step forward in the broader project of obtaining realistic analytical solutions describing the performance of practical machine learning algorithms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn more about our work: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09863\">Link to full paper</a></strong></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"https://dkarkada.xyz/posts/qwem/\">Dhruva Karkada\u2019s blog</a>.</em></p>",

To mitigate the imminent prompt injection threat, we propose two fine-tuning-defenses, StruQ and SecAlign. Without additional cost on computation or human labor, they are utility-preserving effective defenses. StruQ and SecAlign reduce the success rates of over a dozen of optimization-free attacks to around 0%.
